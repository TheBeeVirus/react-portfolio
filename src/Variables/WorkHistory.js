Worked on a prototype breadboard for a children’s doll that interacted with a computer game. Along with testing titles, had to write technical documents including test cases, bug reports, and design suggestions. All documents had to be well written, clear but detailed to allow others to be able to reproduce and understandable without questions. Had the opportunity to work on several different databases and backend systems because we had to adapt to customer’s owned systems. Received commendation from a senior programmer because of how helpful and knowledgeable I was for him during a Dora Explorer project. "
