I did read the C++ and LUA code, even though that was not required, but it allowed me to better understand what was going on. I had to work with a breadboard originally for the beginning of the project. The game was shipped with a doll manufactured by Mattel and had to test the interactions of the doll and game. I was requested by the team to become their sole tester on the project. I even got a recommendation from the senior programmer for all my help on the project, and he suggested I be considered for a programmer position. ",
